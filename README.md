<h1>ZIP WEATHER API</h1>

<p>This app was built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and requires two external APIs. The user enters a zip code into the form: the first API feeds the city name value to the second API, which uses the city name to locate the temperature property and renders that value to the DOM</p>
